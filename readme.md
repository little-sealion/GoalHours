## Development

### Prerequisites
- Flutter (stable) installed and on your PATH
- macOS with Xcode (for iOS Simulator)
- CocoaPods (for iOS dependencies)

### Getting started
1) Install dependencies
	 - Run: `flutter pub get`
2) Generate Isar code (needed after editing files in `lib/data/*.dart` with `@collection`)
	 - One-off: `dart run build_runner build -d`
	 - Watch mode: `dart run build_runner watch -d`

### Running the app
- macOS desktop: `flutter run -d macos`
- iOS Simulator:
	- Open Simulator: `open -a Simulator`
	- List devices: `flutter devices`
	- Run: `flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Plus"`

Hot reload: press `r` in the Flutter run terminal. Hot restart: `R`.

### Testing and checks
- Analyze: `flutter analyze`
- Unit/widget tests: `flutter test`
- Format: `dart format .`

### Notes on the database
- Uses Isar for local storage. The database is opened in the app support directory via `path_provider`.
- If you change model fields, re-run code generation (see above).

### Generated files
- Files like `lib/data/session.g.dart` and `lib/data/project.g.dart` are generated by Isar via build_runner.
- They are committed to VCS so the project builds without running codegen in CI or on a fresh clone.

### Troubleshooting
- iOS: If launch fails with service protocol/DevFS errors:
	- Quit and relaunch Simulator, then retry `flutter run`.
	- Try `flutter run --no-dds`.
	- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.
	- Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are selected (Xcode > Settings > Locations).
- Codegen issues:
	- Run `dart run build_runner clean` then build again.
	- If analyzer version warnings appear, try `flutter pub upgrade`.
